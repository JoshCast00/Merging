In 1991, at the age of nine, Lil Wayne joined Cash Money Records as the youngest member of the label, and half of the duo The B.G.'z, alongside fellow New Orleans-based rapper Lil' Doogie. In 1996, Lil Wayne formed the southern hip hop group Hot Boys, with his Cash Money label-mates Juvenile, Young Turk and Lil' Doogie (who now goes by B.G.). Hot Boys debuted with Get It How U Live!, that same year. Most of the group's success came with their platinum-selling album Guerrilla Warfare (1999) and the 1999 single "Bling Bling". Along with being the flagship artist of Cash Money Records, Lil Wayne is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of his own label imprint, Young Money Entertainment, which he founded in 2005.

Lil Wayne's solo debut album Tha Block Is Hot (1999), was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His subsequent albums, Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2002), went on to be certified gold. Wayne reached higher popularity with his fourth album Tha Carter (2004), which was led by the single "Go D.J." and his appearance on Destiny's Child's Top 10 single "Soldier", that same year. The album was followed by Tha Carter II (2005), as well as several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007.

Following the success of Tha Carter III, Wayne decided to record a rock-esque album titled Rebirth.

In March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an 8-month jail sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007.

Early life

Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where Drake attended high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic Christian from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Through his father, bass guitarist Larry Graham and songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles.[21][22][23][24][25] Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (née Sher) is a white Jewish Canadian, and worked as an educator of English, and as a florist. Drake attended a Jewish day school, and also had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.[26][27][28]

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father chose to return to Memphis in order to find a way to supplement himself financially.[26][27][28] As a child, he witnessed his father's arrest while visiting him in Memphis.[29][30] His father would later collaborate with country music group Arkells for a song entitled "Drake's Dad", detailing the events that had occurred following his departure from Drake's early life.[31]

Drake was raised in two polarizing Toronto neighbourhoods; he lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end,[29] until the sixth grade. In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[32] Drake would then move to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.[33][34] When asked about the move to Forest Hill, Drake replied, "[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."

He attended the Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school.[35] He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood, Drake described the school as "not by any means the easiest school to go to. [It's tough]."[29] Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background,[36] and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school.[37] He would later graduate in October 2012.[38]

Career
2001–05: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, Drake encountered an acting agent who was the father of a high school friend.[39] The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks,[40] a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV."[29] He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from the school depicted within the show. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.[41]
